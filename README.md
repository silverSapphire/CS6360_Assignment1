# CS6360_Assignment1

As far as we can tell, we have completed all requirements of this assignment and tested them successfully on the Oculus Rift in the VR lab.

BONUS POINT: Our bonus room structure is located in Assignment1-2, outside of the laser game room. It was modeled in Blender and has curved walls.

We have both contributed to this code in an equitable manner and agree that, to the best
 of our knowledge, it accurately represents our understanding for the assignment.
